# **Notes From Day 1**

_Today's lesson on GitHib was filled with an assortment of useful knowlege about the use of Git and Github, thanks to some great teachers!!!_

**Here's what was presented:**

* You can clone repositories to your local computer using the .git links posted in the repositories on GitHub by simply pasting them, after typing the 'git clone' command, to the terminal.

* Once you've made changes, you need to add the local repository to the staging area before committing the changes to the remote GitHub repository.

* Once you've committed the changes using the necessary commands, you can refresh you're GitHub page and view the changes made to your remote repository.
